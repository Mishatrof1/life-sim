I have loads of homework and my mother asks me to go to the grocery store with her to help her shop.
What do I do?
* [Go with her anyway.]
    -> res1
* [Tell her I have homework and stay home to do my homework.]
    -> res2
* [Tell her I have homework but go hang out with my friend %FirstName:NPC:2%]
    -> res3
* [Tell her I want to hang out with my friend %FirstName:NPC:2%]

We go to the store and have a good time talking and shopping and I also find $50 in the parking lot!

My mother understands and I stay home and finish my homework. However, I forget to eat and faint.

I play video games with %FirstName:NPC:2% at his place and when my mother comes home and Iâ€™m not there, she grounds me.

My mother tells me if I stay home I have to do my homework. I stay home and do most of my homework but spend a lot of time eating snacks and watching TV.
~TextForLog = "My mother was mad and made me stay home and do homework. I did most of it but decided I needed to unwind with snacks and TV too. Not that I told her that, but it turned out pretty great!"
