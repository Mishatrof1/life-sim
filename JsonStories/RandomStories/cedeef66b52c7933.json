But %FullName:NPC:1% is so thankful to me for doing what I did. Of course, I wasn't going to leave her there! But the experience does actually make us even closer to one another interestingly enough."

But we will be joining the club for golf or tennis or something... not these lunches. But it was still a wonderful afternoon. Just that my wallet is much lighter now."
