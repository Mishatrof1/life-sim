I open it up and there's $400 in there! It must have been money she was saving for something. I guess... to give to me? My family was getting ready to throw that kit out. I now have a whole new understanding of the world."

There's no other reason that money could've showed up there. I do remember back when my grandma was alive she said she had money saved for me... is she trying to give me money?"
